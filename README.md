## 📋 PROJECT DESCRIPTION📋

On this page you can create a totally **personalized business profile card**, choosing the color palette that best suits your personality and adding your contact details like: name, profession, salary range, if you are looking for a job, photo and links to your email, telephone, linkedin and github.

Also, once the card is created, you can share it on Twitter (default option) or on any other social network with the link that we give you for the card.

This project was inspired by **La Duquesa de Alba**, a Spanish pop icon, and has a bit of a humorous undertone, but the coding it's completely serious.
